Only consider receipts with taxi rides occurring within the relevant reporting quarter (e.g., quarter ended 28 February, quarter ended 31 May, quarter ended 31 August, quarter ended 30 November).
Extract the following data from the receipts identified at point 1: date, receipt number, passenger name, pick-up location, drop-off location, total fare, VAT.
Output the data into “taxi_receipts_template.xlsx” and analyse it using only the headings provided: “Date”, “Receipt no.”, “Trip description”, “Passenger”, “Pick-up”, “Drop-off”, “Total fare”, “VAT”, “Net”.
If the drop-off location is a London Airport, record “Sales meeting EMEA” as the “Trip description” in “taxi_receipts_template.xlsx”.
If the drop-off location is not a London Airport, record “TBC” as the “Trip description” in “taxi_receipts_template.xlsx”.
“VAT” should only be populated in “taxi_receipts_template.xlsx” if the receipt quotes a VAT registration number.
All VAT included in “taxi_receipts_template.xlsx” must be at the standard rate.
“Net” is calculated as the “Total fare” less “VAT”.
